## Overview
The Speech Recognition Web App is a simple application that utilizes modern web technologies to enable speech recognition and synthesis. Users can speak to the application, and it will transcribe their speech in real-time while also providing audio feedback through speech synthesis. This project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of the Web Speech API and provide a user-friendly interface for speech interaction.

## Features
- Real-time speech recognition
- Voice feedback using speech synthesis
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Static file serving with Express.js

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Flask
- **APIs**: Web Speech API
